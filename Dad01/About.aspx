	<p>Here is what Derek has to say about the Dundrum Academy Of Driving:</p>

<div class="quote">
	<p>With many years experience, initially gained in two of the country's largest driving schools. </p>
	<p> We have: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Helped students to overcome anxieties. </li>
	<li>Given confidence to senior citizens who want to re-establish independent driving. </li>
	<li>Worked with nervous pupils to successfully pass their test.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>
	We also observe and teach foreign nationals (some of whom already hold full drivers licence in their own country) so they are familiar and confident in the rules and regulations of driving in Ireland. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If you need a family member or friend to sit with you in the car to assist with language barriers. Just mention it at the time of booking.
