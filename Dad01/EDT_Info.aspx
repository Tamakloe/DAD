    <div class="dropList_content">
        <div>
            <p> Essential Driver Training (EDT) is a mandatory training course that teaches fundamental driving skills to learner car drivers. It is part of the RSA’s Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) scheme and is intended to improve road safety.
                EDT is only part of the learning process, you will need lots of practice and may need more lessons to become a safe driver.

    <div class="dropList_header"><img class="buttonTick"src="Images/buttonTick.PNG" alt="tick" height= "20px" />Why Learner Drivers need EDT?</div>
    <div class="dropList_content">
        <div>
            <p> Studies show that young drivers and inexperienced drivers are more likely to die or be seriously injured in collisions, and EDT is one of several measures introduced by the RSA to help improve critical driving knowledge, skills and behaviours of new drivers.
                If the issue date of your first B category (Car) learner permit is on or after 4 April 2011, in order to be able to sit your full driving test, you must first complete all EDT lessons.
            </p>
            <p>If you are not required to complete EDT, you may still choose to take an EDT course, as it can help increase your chances of passing the driving test and will help make you a better safer driver.</p>

     <div class="dropList_header"><img class="buttonTick"src="Images/buttonTick.PNG" alt="tick" height= "20px" /> What does EDT involve?</div>
     <div class="dropList_content">
        <div>
            <p> EDT is a course of 12 modules. These modules are designed to cover certain critical driving skills and improve your practical driving skills.
                As you complete each module, your Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) will record your progress in a special on-line logbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should also have a Sponsor, an experienced driver (many learner drivers choose a family member) who will supervise your driving practice outside of lessons, and will also track your progress in your logbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you progress through your EDT course, you may still need additional lessons with an ADI to improve your driving skills. Additionally, you should practice with your Sponsor as much as possible to get comfortable behind the wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of your driving test, you should print off the <strong>'EDT Completed'</strong> confirmation from your on-line logbook and bring it with you to the appointed test centre, as you may be required to show it to the examiner.
            </p>

     <div class="dropList_header"><img class="buttonTick"src="Images/buttonTick.PNG" alt="tick" height= "20px" />What does EDT cost? </div>
     <div class="dropList_content">
        <div>
            <p> There is no set charge for EDT lessons and each ADI sets their own fees. ILDT recommends that you contact several ADI's to enquire about the fees and also to see if the if the ADI is right for you. 
                Recommendations from family and friends may also prove useful in helping you to make your choice.

    <div class="dropList_header"><img class="buttonTick"src="Images/buttonTick.PNG" alt="tick" height= "20px" />How to Find an ADI?</div>
    <div class="dropList_content">
        <div>

            <p> EDT can only be delivered by an RSA-approved instructor, an ADI.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may switch ADIs during the EDT course, but remember to get your current ADI to sign off on your completed lessons before you make any changes.
